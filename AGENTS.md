role: Act as a senior API architect.

## work_mode
- Work IN-PLACE inside the existing workspace.
- Do not scaffold a new repository.
- Update the current Maven project named "fault-api" only.
- Create or modify files under:
  - src/main/java/com/upfault/fault/api/**
  - src/test/java/**
- Do not delete or rename existing files unless explicitly stated.

## io_contract
- Produce outputs as unified diffs (git-style) with paths relative to repo root.
- Do not include markdown headings or styling in generated diffs or source content.

## project_constraints
- Single API-only Jar for Paper 1.21.8 on Java 21.
- No plugin.yml, no implementations, no schedulers, no storage.
- Cross-plugin access only via Bukkit ServicesManager.
- Avoid deprecated Bukkit APIs; prefer modern Paper types.
- No NMS in the API.
- Any possibly blocking work returns CompletableFuture<T>.
- Package root: com.upfault.fault.api.
- Maven coordinates: groupId=com.upfault, artifactId=fault-api, version=0.0.1.
- Compiler: <maven.compiler.release>21</maven.compiler.release>.
- Dependencies:
  - io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.21.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT (scope: provided)
  - net.kyori:adventure-api (scope: api)
  - org.jetbrains:annotations (scope: api)
- No shading.
- Javadoc on all public types with @since, @apiNote, and threading notes.
- README documents SemVer policy and consumer usage.

## design_rules
- Services are interfaces only, with explicit threading contracts.
- DTOs are Java records; prefer UUID and simple value types; do not leak Bukkit classes in signatures.
- Use sealed result types instead of unchecked exceptions at the API boundary.
- Namespaced IDs everywhere; short and stable names.
- All text surfaces use Adventure Components.
- Document which methods are main-thread vs any-thread safe.

## task
- Implement/extend the API surfaces described by the repository brief:
  - Create interfaces, records, and minimal Bukkit/Paper events.
  - Organize into logical subpackages under com.upfault.fault.api.*.
  - Add comprehensive Javadoc and a short example of service lookup via ServicesManager.

## output_format
- Provide unified diffs for new and changed files.
- Include updated POM only if missing required dependencies or compiler settings.
- Include README/CHANGELOG/LICENSE updates as diffs.
- No markdown, no HTML, no screenshots.

## acceptance
- mvn -U -DskipTests package passes on Java 21.
- No deprecated API usage.
- Public API limited to interfaces/records/enums/events plus Fault helper.
- No plugin.yml and no NMS/CraftBukkit references.
- paper-api is provided scope; Adventure and JetBrains annotations are api scope.
- Threading guarantees documented in Javadoc for every public method.
